## Overview
- Predicted next time steps
- Dataset made using 100 points and corresponding `cosine function` 
- Mean Squared Error(`MSE`) is used as evaluation metric
- Achieved 0.0019 Mean Squared Error(MSE) using simple `Recurrent Neural Network`

## Packages
- torch
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Result Visualization

## Algorithms
Simple Recurrent Neural Network

## Conclusions
- Very first time series prediction is done with a Simple Rnn.
- Time-series prediction can be applied to many tasks - weather forecasting or predicting the ebb and flow of stock market prices.
- Predictions can also be generated much further in the future than just one-time step!
